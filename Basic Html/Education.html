        <h2><a href="#"> SCHOLARSHIP   FACILITY</a></h2>
          <p>  The realm of scholarships is full of misconceptions. Some of the most common myths about scholarships in India are –
              Scholarships are available only for students belonging to economically backward classes or underserved sections of the society.
            Only meritorious students are eligible to get a scholarship.The amount of scholarship that a student receives is not worth your efforts.
s            Applying for a scholarship is a tedious task and involves you to follow too many guidelines.
            You can apply for only one scholarship
